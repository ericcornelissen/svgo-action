# Contributing Guidelines

The _SVGO Action_ project welcomes contributions and corrections of all forms.
This includes improvements to the documentation or code base, new tests, bug
fixes, and implementations of new features. We recommend you [open an issue]
before making any substantial changes so you can be sure your work won't be
rejected. But for small changes, such as fixing a typo, you can open a Pull
Request directly.

If you plan to make a contribution, please do make sure to read through the
relevant sections of this document.

## Reporting Issues

### Security

For security related issues, please refer to the [security policy].

### Bug Reports

If you have problems with the project or think you've found a bug, please report
it to the developers; we ask you to **always** open an issue describing the bug
as soon as possible so that we, and others, are aware of the bug.

Before reporting a bug, make sure you've actually found a real bug. Carefully
read the documentation and see if it really says you can do what you're trying
to do. If it's not clear whether you should be able to do something or not,
report that too; it's a bug in the documentation! Also, make sure the bug has
not already been reported.

When preparing to report a bug, try to isolate it to a small working example
that reproduces the problem. Once you have this, collect additional information
such as:

- The exact version of the Action you're using.
- A description of the expected behaviour and the actual behaviour.
- All error and warning messages.
- A link to a workflow run where the bug occurs with [debug logging] enabled.

Once you have a precise problem you can submit a [bug report].

### Feature Requests

New features are welcomed, but we want to avoid feature creep. For this reason
we recommend you open a [feature request] first so you don't spend time working
on something that won't be included. Make sure the feature hasn't been requested
before.

### Corrections

Corrections, such as fixing typos or refactoring code, are important. For
smaller changes of this nature you can open a Pull Request directly, or [open an
issue] first if you prefer.

## Making Changes

You are always free to contribute by working on one of the confirmed or accepted
(and unassigned) [open issues] and opening a Pull Request for it.

It is advised to indicate that you will be working on a issue by commenting on
that issue. This is so others don't start working on the same issue as you are.
Also, don't start working on an issue which someone else is working on - give
everyone a chance to make contributions.

When you open a Pull Request that implements an issue make sure to link to that
issue in the Pull Request description and explain how you implemented the issue
as clearly as possible.

> [!NOTE]
> If you, for whatever reason, can not continue your work, please share this in
> the issue or your Pull Request. This gives others an opportunity to work on
> it. If we don't hear from you for an extended period of time we may decide to
> allow others to work on the issue you were assigned to.

### Prerequisites

To be able to contribute you need the following tooling:

- [Git];
- [Node.js] v20 or higher and [npm] v8.1.2 or higher;
- (Recommended) a code editor with [EditorConfig] support;
- (Suggested) [actionlint] (see `.tool-versions` for preferred version);
- (Suggested) [hadolint] (see `.tool-versions` for preferred version);
- (Suggested) [ShellCheck] (see `.tool-versions` for preferred version);
- (Optional) [act] v0.2.22 or higher;
- (Optional) [Docker];

### Workflow

If you decide to make a contribution, please use the following workflow:

- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch from the latest `main`.
- Make your changes on the new branch.
- Commit to the new branch and push the commit(s).
- Open a Pull Request against `main`.

### Development Details

Before you start making changes you should run `npm install`. This ensures your
local development environment is setup and ready to go.

[husky] is used to automatically install git hooks. Please enable it when
contributing to the project. If you have npm installation scripts disabled,
run `npm run prepare` after installing dependencies.

When making a contribution make sure your changes are [tested](#testing),
[well-formatted](#linting), [audited](#auditing) and [vetted](#vetting). Run
`npm run verify` to check if this is the case.

#### Building

This project uses [rollup.js] to compile the source code into a standalone
JavaScript file (which can be found in the `lib/` directory). This is so that it
can be invoked as a standalone "executable" when used as an Action. Otherwise
the the contents of `node_modules/` would have to be included in the repository.

The file is generated using the `npm run build` command; you can run this
command to see if your changes are valid. You should **not** include changes to
this file when committing - if you try to commit it, the pre-commit hook will
automatically unstage the changes.

Instead, the file will be updated automatically prior to a release as well as
build when necessary for testing.

#### Linting

This project uses linters to enforce code style and catch mistakes. Use the
command `npm run lint` to run all linters or `npm run format` to update
formatting automatically.

Alternatively, you can use one of the following to lint using individual tools:

| Category                 | Command               | Linter                 |
| :----------------------- | :-------------------- | :--------------------- |
| CI workflows             | `npm run lint:ci`     | [actionlint]           |
| `Dockerfile`             | `npm run lint:docker` | [hadolint]             |
| JavaScript (`.{cjs,js}`) | `npm run lint:js`     | [ESLint]               |
| JSON (`.json`)           | `npm run lint:json`   | [eslint-plugin-json]   |
| MarkDown (`.md`)         | `npm run lint:md`     | [markdownlint]         |
| Shell scripts (`.{,sh}`) | `npm run lint:sh`     | [ShellCheck]           |
| TypeScript (`.ts`)       | `npm run lint:ts`     | [ESLint]               |
| Whitespace (`.*`)        | `npm run lint:ws`     | [editorconfig-checker] |
| YAML (`.yml`)            | `npm run lint:yml`    | [eslint-plugin-yml]    |

If you want to improve the code style, update the configuration file for the
respective linter accordingly. If you need an extra package to be able to
enforce your style, add it as a `devDependency`.

> [!NOTE]
> Keep in mind that the developers of the project determine the code style as
> they see fit. For this reason, take the time to explain why you think your
> changes improve the project.

#### Vetting

The project is vetted using a small collection of static analysis tools. Run
`npm run vet` to analyze the project for potential problems.

#### Auditing

##### Vulnerabilities

To scan for vulnerabilities in all dependencies, run `npm run audit`. To scan
only production dependencies, run `npm run audit:prod`.

##### Licenses

This project uses [licensee] to check for potential license violations in
project dependencies. To validate the licenses, run `npm run license-check`.
This will output nothing if no problems are detected, or output a list of
packages without approved licenses and exit with a non-zero exit code if there
is any violation.

The configuration, including allowed licenses and exceptions, can be found in
`.licensee.json`.

## Testing

It is important to test any changes and equally important to add tests
previously untested code. Tests for this project are written using [Jest]. All
tests go into the `test/` folder and all test files should follow the naming
convention `[FILENAME].test.ts`.

The tests for the project are split between unit, integration, and end-to-end
(e2e) test. Various commands are available to run the tests, as shown in the
overview below. You can run a command as `npm run [SCRIPT]:[MODIFIER]`, e.g.
`npm run test` or `npm run coverage:unit`.

| Script             | Modifier           | Description            |
| :----------------- | :----------------- | :--------------------- |
| `test`, `coverage` | `all` _(optional)_ | Runs all tests         |
| `test`, `coverage` | `unit`             | Runs unit tests        |
| `test`, `coverage` | `integration`      | Runs integration tests |
| `test`             | `e2e`              | Runs end-to-end tests  |
| `test`             | `mutation`         | Runs mutation tests    |

Whenever you use the `coverage` variant of a script, a coverage report will be
generated. The report is available in HTML format at
`_reports/coverage/[MODIFIER]/lcov-report/index.html`.

### Mocking

We make extensive use of [mocking]. A mock for a particular file goes into the
`__mocks__` folder inside the folder of that file. The name of a mock file
should always match the name of the file it mocks.

Mocks for Node.js modules go into the `__mocks__` directory at the root of the
project. The name of the mock file should always match the name of the Node.js
module. For scoped Node.js modules, the mock file should be placed in a folder
with the name of the scope. For example, the mock for `@actions/core` can be
found at `__mocks__/@actions/core.ts`.

Any non-mock file inside a `__mocks__` folder should follow the naming
convention `__[FILENAME]__.ts`.

Any mock that is not tied to a file or Node.js module, or that includes one or
more characters illegal on some file systems, should be placed in the
`test/__common__` folder and follow the naming convention `[FILENAME].mock.ts`.

### Unit Testing

All unit tests go into the `test/unit` folder, which mimics the structure of the
`src/` folder. To run unit tests you can use the `npm run test:unit` command.
Use `npm run coverage:unit` to run unit tests and get a coverage report.

A unit test suite should cover one and only one file. For examples of how to
achieve this you can study existing unit tests. To check that a unit test does
not rely on any other code you can run the following command and check the
resulting coverage report.

```shell
npm run coverage -- test/unit/[PATH TO FILE]
```

#### Mutation Testing

The quality of unit tests is measured using [mutation testing]. We use the
mutation testing framework [StrykerJS]. Use the command `npm run test:mutation`
to run the mutation tests.

After running the mutation tests, a mutation report is available in HTML format
at `_reports/mutation/index.html`.

By default the mutation tests run on all the source code using all the unit
tests. The first time you run the mutation tests can be rather slow. However,
this project leverages Stryker's incremental mode, meaning that subsequent runs
of the mutation tests are much faster.

If you don't have time for an initial slow run, you can opt to change the config
in `stryker.config.js` to focus on a subset of the source code or unit tests
(you should never commit such changes). For example, to run mutation tests for
a particular source code file you can change the config as follows.

```diff
  mutate: [
-   "src/**/*.ts",
+   "src/path/to/file.ts",
    "!src/**/*.d.ts",
    "!src/**/__mocks__/**/*.ts",
  ],
  commandRunner: {
-   command: "npm run test:unit -- --runInBand",
+   command: "npm run test -- --runInBand test/unit/path/to/file.test.ts",
  },
```

### Integration Testing

All integrations tests go into the `test/integration` folder, which mimics the
top-level structure of the `src/` folder. To run integration tests you can use
the `npm run test:integration` command. Use `npm run coverage:integration` to
run the integration tests and get a coverage report.

An integration test suite aims to verify that different units work together
correctly. As such, while an integration test should still focus on one thing,
it is generally not necessary to mock anything (exceptions include file system
operations and network communication).

### End-to-End Testing

The end-to-end tests are defined in the `test-e2e` job in the GitHub Actions
workflow file `check.yml`. The test operate with and on the fixtures found in
`test/end-to-end`. During end-to-end testing, the Action is run as if it was
triggered by a `schedule` event.

The end-to-end tests verify three things:

1. That the source code (in `src/`, not `lib/`) can be run as an Action,
1. That the Action outputs are correct, and
1. That SVGs are modified on disk.

#### Running End-to-end Tests Locally

You can use [act] to run the end-to-end tests locally. If you have the `act`
program available on your PATH you can use `npm run test:e2e` to run the e2e
tests.

There are some limitations to using [act]:

- It depends on [Docker] to run workflows.
- Your system may not support all operating systems the tests should run on.
  Hence, the end-to-end tests may succeed locally but fail on GitHub because you
  couldn't run them for all operating systems.
- All jobs that the end-to-end test job `needs` have to be executed as well.
