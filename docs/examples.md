## Optimize on Pushes

This example uses [actions/checkout] and [stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action]
to automatically optimize and commit new or modified SVGs in commits pushed to
the `main` branch. If there are no changes, nothing will be committed.

Check out [what the Action outputs] to customize the commit message to your
liking.

```yml
# .github/workflows/optimize.yml

name: Optimize
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

# The minimum required permissions
permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  svgs:
    name: SVGs
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Optimize SVGs
        uses: ericcornelissen/svgo-action@v3
        id: svgo
        with:
          repo-token: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
      - name: Commit optimizations
        uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4
        if: ${{steps.svgo.outputs.DID_OPTIMIZE}}
        with:
          commit_message: Optimize ${{steps.svgo.outputs.OPTIMIZED_COUNT}} SVG(s)
```

---

## Optimize Pull Requests with Comments

This example uses [actions/checkout], [stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action],
and [thollander/actions-comment-pull-request] to automatically optimize and
commit new or modified SVGs for Pull Requests into the `main` branch. It will
also comment on the Pull Request that optimizations have been committed. If
there are no changes, nothing will be committed or commented.

Check out [what the Action outputs] to customize the commit message and Pull
Request comment to your liking.

> **Warning** This does not work for Pull Requests from forks. This is because
> GitHub Actions do not have permission to alter forked repositories.

```yml
# .github/workflows/optimize.yml

name: Optimize
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

# The minimum required permissions
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-request: write

jobs:
  svgs:
    name: SVGs
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Optimize SVGs
        uses: ericcornelissen/svgo-action@v3
        id: svgo
        with:
          repo-token: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
      - name: Commit optimizations
        uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4
        if: ${{steps.svgo.outputs.DID_OPTIMIZE}}
        with:
          commit_message: Optimize ${{steps.svgo.outputs.OPTIMIZED_COUNT}} SVG(s)
      - name: Comment on Pull Request
        uses: thollander/actions-comment-pull-request@v1
        if: ${{steps.svgo.outputs.DID_OPTIMIZE && github.event_name == 'pull_request'}}
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
          message: Optimized ${{steps.svgo.outputs.OPTIMIZED_COUNT}} SVG(s)
```

## Scheduled Optimization Commits

This example uses [actions/checkout] and [stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action]
to optimize and commit all SVGs in the repository every Monday. If there are no
changes, nothing will be committed.

Check out [what the Action outputs] to customize the commit message to your
liking.

```yml
# .github/workflows/optimize.yml

name: Optimize
on:
  schedule:
    # Schedule the workflow for once a week on Monday.
    # For more information, see: https://crontab.guru/
    - cron: "0 0 * * 1"

# The minimum required permissions
permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  svgs:
    name: SVGs
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Optimize SVGs
        uses: ericcornelissen/svgo-action@v3
        id: svgo
      - name: Commit optimizations
        uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4
        if: ${{steps.svgo.outputs.DID_OPTIMIZE}}
        with:
          commit_message: Optimize ${{steps.svgo.outputs.OPTIMIZED_COUNT}} SVG(s)
```

---

## Scheduled Optimization Pull Requests

This example uses [actions/checkout] and [peter-evans/create-pull-request] to
optimize all SVGs in the repository every Monday and create a Pull Request for
these optimizations. If there are no changes, no commit or Pull Request will be
created.

Check out [what the Action outputs] to customize the Pull Request and commit
message to your liking.

```yml
# .github/workflows/optimize.yml

name: Optimize
on:
  schedule:
    # Schedule the workflow for once a week on Monday.
    # For more information, see: https://crontab.guru/
    - cron: "0 0 * * 1"

# The minimum required permissions
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  svgs:
    name: SVGs
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Optimize SVGs
        uses: ericcornelissen/svgo-action@v3
        id: svgo
      - name: Create Pull Request for optimized SVGs
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4
        if: ${{steps.svgo.outputs.DID_OPTIMIZE}}
        with:
          commit-message: Optimize ${{steps.svgo.outputs.OPTIMIZED_COUNT}} SVG(s)
          title: Optimize ${{steps.svgo.outputs.OPTIMIZED_COUNT}} SVG(s)
          body: _This Pull Request was created automatically_
          branch: optimize-svgs
```

---

## Optimize SVGs on Demand

This example uses [actions/checkout] and [stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action]
to optimize and commit all SVGs in the repository on `workflow_dispatch` events.
You can trigger this either by making an HTTP request to a specific GitHub
endpoint (see comment in the snippet) or on GitHub by navigating to the
workflow's page in your repository.

Check out [what the Action outputs] to customize the commit message to your
liking.

```yml
# .github/workflows/optimize.yml

name: Optimize
on:
  - workflow_dispatch

# This Workflow can be triggered in the UI or using the GitHub API:
# - To trigger it in the UI, follow:
#   https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow
#
# - To trigger it using the GitHub API, use:
#     curl -X POST \
#          -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
#          -d '{"ref":"main"}' \
#          https://api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/workflows/optimize.yml/dispatches
#
#   Replacing <token> by a personal access token with scope `public_repo`,
#   <owner> by the repositories owner (user or organization), <repo> by the
#   repositories name.
#
#   Notes:
#   - "main" in the payload (-d) refers to the branch on which the workflow
#     should be triggered. Usually you want this to be the default branch.
#   - "optimize.yml" in the URL has to be updated if the workflow file is not
#     called "optimize.yml".

# The minimum required permissions
permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  svgs:
    name: SVGs
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Optimize SVGs
        uses: ericcornelissen/svgo-action@v3
        id: svgo
      - name: Commit optimizations
        uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4
        if: ${{steps.svgo.outputs.DID_OPTIMIZE}}
        with:
          commit_message: Optimize ${{steps.svgo.outputs.OPTIMIZED_COUNT}} SVG(s)
```

---

## Limit Runs

This example uses [path filters] to optimize SVGs only if any `.svg` file in the
repository was changed on `push` events. Even though this Action does nothing
if a push (or Pull Request) touches no SVGs, you may want the Action to run only
when an SVG has actually changed.

> **Warning** This will cause the entire Workflow to be run only when an SVG
> changes. Jobs that should run for every push or Pull Request must be specified
> in a separate Workflow file.

```yml
# .github/workflows/optimize.yml

name: Optimize
on:
  # Both `push` and `pull_request` support path
  push:
    paths:
      - "**.svg"

# The minimum required permissions
permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  svgs:
    name: SVGs
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Optimize SVGs
        uses: ericcornelissen/svgo-action@v3
        with:
          repo-token: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
      # Your steps ...
```

## Using Any SVGO Version

This example uses [actions/checkout] and [npm] to optimize SVGs in the project
using a specific version of SVGO. You can combine this example with one of the
other examples in this document to get the optimized SVGs back in your project.

```yml
# .github/workflows/optimize.yml

name: Optimize
on:
  # You can replace "schedule" with any other event you need and this example
  # will still work.
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * 1"

# The minimum required permissions
permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  svgs:
    name: SVGs
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      # If SVGO is a (dev)dependency of your project you can just install your
      # dependencies as usual. If SVGO is not yet a dependency of your project,
      # we recommend you run `npm install --save-dev svgo@v2` and commit your
      # project manifests (e.g. package.json and package-lock.json) first.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm clean-install
      - name: Optimize SVGs
        uses: ericcornelissen/svgo-action@v3
        with:
          svgo-version: project
```
