# SVGO Action Events

This documentation describes the behavior of the SVGO Action for every GitHub
Actions event that is supported. If an event is not listed here it is not
officially supported.

- [`on: pull_request`](#on-pull_request)
- [`on: push`](#on-push)
- [`on: repository_dispatch`](#dispatch-events)
- [`on: schedule`](#on-schedule)
- [`on: workflow_dispatch`](#dispatch-events)

Please [open an issue] if you found a mistake or if you have suggestions for how
to improve the documentation.

---

> **Warning** The Action will run on any event if [strict mode] is not enabled.
> However, this is not officially supported so you may encounter unexpected
> behaviour.

## `on: pull_request`

> Find out more in the GitHub Actions documentation on [`pull_request` events],
> [branch and tag filters], and [path filters].

In the `pull_request` context the SVGO Action will optimize all SVGs that have
been added or modified in the Pull Request. Any SVGs that are in the repository
but have not been modified in the Pull Request will not be optimized.

The Action will never modify SVGs that are already optimized or [SVGs that are
ignored].
