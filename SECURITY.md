## Reporting a Vulnerability

The maintainers of this project take security bugs very seriously. We appreciate
your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings. Due to the non-funded and
open-source nature of this project, we take a best-efforts approach when it
comes to engaging with (security) reports.

To report a security issue in a supported version of the project, send an email
to [security@ericcornelissen.dev] and include the terms "SECURITY" and
"svgo-action" in the subject line. Please do not open a regular issue or Pull
Request in the public repository.

If you found a security bug in an unsupported version of the project, please
report this publicly. For example, as a regular issue in the public repository.
