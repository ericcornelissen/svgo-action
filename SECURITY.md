# Security Policy

The maintainers of the _SVGO Action_ project take security issues seriously. We
appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings. Due to the
non-funded and open-source nature of the project, we take a best-efforts
approach when it comes to engaging with security reports.

## Supported Versions

The table below shows which versions of the project are currently supported with
security updates.

| Version | End-of-life |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue in the latest version of a supported version range,
either (in order of preference):

- [Report it through GitHub][new github advisory], or
- Send an email to [security@ericcornelissen.dev] with the terms "SECURITY" and
  "svgo-action" in the subject line.

Please do not open a regular issue or Pull Request in the public repository.

To report a security issue in an unsupported version of the project, or if the
latest version of a supported version range isn't affected, please report it
publicly. For example, as a regular issue in the public repository. If in doubt,
report the issue privately.
