## Reporting a Vulnerability

The maintainers of the SVGO Action take security bugs very seriously. We
appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings. Due to the
non-funded open-source nature of this project, we take a best-efforts approach
when it comes to engaging with (security) reports.

To report a security issue, send an email to [security@ericcornelissen.dev] and
include the words _"SECURITY"_ and _"SVGO Action"_ in the subject line. Please
do not open a regular issue or Pull Request in the public repository.
